Yoga Studio Main Page Responsive Website

The purpose of this project was to create an example of what a responsive website for a friend's Yoga studio could look like. My main objective was to ensure that the website would adjust according to the screen size of the user. The elements needed to properly render on mobile devices and on desktops.

The design is meant to be minimalist and center the user's attention to the key elements chosen to be displayed.

The languages used to code this project were HTML & CSS.
